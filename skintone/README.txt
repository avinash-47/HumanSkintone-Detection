This is the main code for the HumanSkintone image detection website.

*To run the website open the file path in a command terminal or anaconda prompt.

*Navigate into the skintone folder inside the main project folder.

*Create a virtual environment in that file path.

*Activate the virtual environment, after that type command "pip install -r requirements.txt" which will install all the packages necessary to run the website already mentioned in the "requirements" text document.

*Finally, type command "python manage.py runserver" to run the server and open the website on a browser on your local machine.

Enjoy!
